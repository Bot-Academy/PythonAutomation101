## Important
Liking too many posts in a short period of time can lead to like blocks on Instagram. Playing too many idle rounds in Fortnite can lead to a temporary ban. Don’t use these Bots with your main accounts & improve them to reduce the risk of blocks / bans. They can be easily improved with what you’ve learned in this video!

## Limitations
1. Sometimes the Fortnite Launcher fails to start - just restart the program and try again (I have no idea why this happens)
2. Fortnite needs to be started in fullscreen mode with a resolution of 1920x1080 - if you're using another resolution, you need to update the values/positions as shown in the video. Please share the updated values that you used for your resolution.
3. There might be other bugs that I haven't encountered - the only purpose of the code is to demonstrate and test different automation concept so that you can create your own automated programs
